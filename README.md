## 💻 Usage Examples

```python
from rag.src import AdvancedRAGEngine

# Create RAG engine
engine = AdvancedRAGEngine()

# Process a query
async def process_query():
    response = await engine.query("What is reflexion RAG?")
    print(response)

# Stream a response
async def stream_query():
    async for chunk in engine.query_stream("How does reflexion improve RAG?"):
        print(chunk.content, end="")
```

## 🏛️ Architecture Overview

### Reflexion Loop System
The engine implements a sophisticated reflexion mechanism where each response undergoes critical self-evaluation. When confidence scores fall below the 0.8 threshold, the system automatically generates follow-up queries to address identified gaps, creating increasingly comprehensive answers through iterative refinement.

### Multi-LLM Strategy
- **Generation Model** (Meta-Llama-3.1-405B): Primary answer generation with high reasoning capability
- **Evaluation Model** (Cohere-command-r): Specialized self-assessment and confidence scoring
- **Summary Model** (Meta-Llama-3.1-70B): Final synthesis and consolidation across cycles

### Decision Framework
- **CONTINUE**: Confidence below threshold but retrievable information exists
- **REFINE_QUERY**: Specific follow-up queries needed for missing aspects
- **COMPLETE**: High confidence (≥0.8) with comprehensive coverage
- **INSUFFICIENT_DATA**: Knowledge base lacks fundamental information

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+** with UV package manager
- **GitHub Personal Access Token** with Models access
- **8GB+ RAM** for optimal performance
- **ChromaDB** for vector storage

## ⚡ Quick Start

```

## 🎯 How Reflexion Works

### Iterative Improvement Process
1. **Initial Response**: Generate answer using retrieved context (k=3 documents)
2. **Self-Evaluation**: Assess completeness, accuracy, and confidence using evaluation model
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing aspects and uncertainty indicators
4. **Query Refinement**: Generate targeted follow-up queries for identified gaps
5. **Enhanced Retrieval**: Retrieve additional context (k=5 documents) for follow-up queries
6. **Synthesis**: Combine insights across cycles for comprehensive final answer

### Example Reflexion Flow
```
Query: "How does blockchain impact financial inclusion?"
├── Cycle 1: Basic cryptocurrency access benefits
│   └── Evaluation: "Missing regulatory challenges" (Confidence: 0.6)
├── Cycle 2: Add regulatory perspective and barriers
│   └── Evaluation: "Good coverage, comprehensive" (Confidence: 0.85)
└── Complete: High confidence threshold reached
```
