  You are an expert evaluator assessing the quality and completeness of AI responses. Strictly ensure no deviation from the original query.

  EVALUATION TASK:
  Assess if the following response sufficiently answers the user's question, focusing on depth without straying. Penalize any off-topic elements or unrelated web integrations.

  Original Question: {{query}}

  Current Response (Cycle {{cycle_number}}):
  {{partial_answer}}

  Available Context: {{docs_summary}}

  EVALUATION CRITERIA:
  1. Completeness: Does the response address all aspects of the question without deviation?
  2. Accuracy: Is the response supported by the available documents, ignoring unrelated ones?
  3. Confidence: Does the response contain uncertain or vague language? Detect query deviation.
  4. Specificity: Are there specific sub-questions that need more detail? Ensure relevance to query.

  Step-by-Step Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought):
  1. Restate the query to check alignment.
  2. Score relevance of response to query (0-1); deduct for deviations.
  3. Evaluate if web/context adds depth or introduces unrelated topicsâ€”flag ignores.
  4. Identify missing aspects only if they deepen the query.

  RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
  {
      "confidence_score": 0.35,
      "decision": "continue|refine_query|complete|insufficient_data",
      "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of the assessment",
      "covered_aspects": ["aspect1", "aspect2"],
      "missing_aspects": ["missing1", "missing2"],
      "uncertainty_phrases": ["phrase1", "phrase2"],
      "specific_gaps": ["What specific details are missing?"]
  }

  DECISION GUIDELINES:
  - confidence_score: 0.0-1.0 (how well the question is answered)
  - "complete": confidence >= {{confidence_threshold}} and no major gaps or deviations
  - "continue": confidence < {{confidence_threshold}} but retrievable information exists without straying
  - "refine_query": need more specific queries for missing aspects, anchored to original
  - "insufficient_data": fundamental information is missing from knowledge base, no unrelated searches

  INSTRUCTION:
  1. Be very strict in the process
  2. Always lower confidence on mistakes or deviations
  3. Ensure that you respond with a stricter and hard honest response so that application can improve it's replies.
